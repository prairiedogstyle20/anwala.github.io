Assignment #4
Due: 11:59pm February 27

The "friendship paradox" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendship_paradox)
says that your friends have more friends than you do.  

1.  Determine if the friendship paradox holds for my Facebook
account.* Compute the mean, standard deviation, and median of the
number of friends that my friends have.  Create a graph of the
number of friends (y-axis) and the friends themselves, sorted by
number of friends (y-axis).  (The friends don't need to be labeled
on the x-axis: just f1, f2, f3, ... fn.)  Do include me in the graph
and label me accordingly.

* = This used to be more interesting when you could more easily download
your friend's friends data from Facebook.  Facebook now requires each
friend to approve this operation, effectively making it impossible.

I will upload a csv file of my 2014 friends list on the #assignment-4 slack channel

2.  Determine if the friendship paradox holds for your Twitter account.
Since Twitter is a directed graph, use "followers" as value you measure
(i.e., "do your followers have more followers than you?").

Generate the same graph as in question #1, and calcuate the same 
mean, standard deviation, and median values.

For the Twitter 1.1 API to help gather this data, see:

If you do not have followers on Twitter (or don't have more than 50),
then use my twitter account "acnwala".

3.  Repeat question #1, but with your (or a specified) LinkedIn profile.

4.  Repeat question #2, but change "followers" to "following"?  In
other words, are the people I am following following more people?
